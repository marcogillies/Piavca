    PiavcaCal3dImp Project Overview
========================================================================

This is an implementation of the Piavca API using Cal3d as the underlying animation library.
Cal3d does all the skinning, morph targets and Piavca handles the animation blending.

Compiling it creates a library that combines it with PiavcaAPI and StdMotionImplementation and then
can be used to link to C++ applications or the Python bindings.
