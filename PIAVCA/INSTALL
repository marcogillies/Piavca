PIAVCA - The Platform Independent API for Virtual Characters and Avatars

This file gives installation instructions for Piavca. For full documentation
see the Doc directory or visit www.XXX?

UNIX

Piavca has a standard automake installation procedure:

cd PIAVCA
./configure
make
make install

you might need to run the last command as root. run ./configure --help to get the available options

if you need to regenerate the configure file you can run 

sh ./autogen.sh

Piavca has a number of dependencies:

Yacc and Lex (Bison and Flex): are standard on almost all unices, some (e.g. Ubuntu) don't 
install them as standard but you can just install the bison and flex packages

Automake, Autoconf, aclocal, autoheader, libtools: only needed if you want to regenerated the
configure file. Again these are UNIX standards and should exist as standard packages if they
aren't installed already

Python: if you want to use the python bindings you need to have python installed, if its installed 
somewhere standard it should just work, otherwise you need to ???

Cal3D: this is a lower level character animation library. The eventual plan is to remove 
dependencies on it but its needed for now. You can get it from: 

http://cal3d.sourceforge.net/

If you install it in the standard place (/usr/install/local) configure will find it, otherwise 
you need to ????

WINDOWS

A set of Visual Studio .Net project files are in the VStudio directory (at time of writing, 2006,
a free (beer) version of VS can be downloaded from the microsoft site). Building Piavca is a little bit 
more difficult than under UNIX as I don't know of a portable way to handle include paths etc using VStudio.
Here is how to deal with the dependencies:

Yacc and Lex: the project file assumes that you have the commands bison and flex in your path

Python: you don't need to use the python bindings (if you don't don't compile PiavcaPythonInterface 
and make the changes to PiavcaCal3dApp listed below). If you do want to use if you need to install python
and change the following:

PiavcaPythonInterface->Properties->C/C++->Additional Include Directories add the path to Python.h
PiavcaPythonInterface->Properties->Librarian->Additional Library Directories add the path to Python.lib

you might need the debug binaries of python to build Piavca in debug. I've put a zip file of the Python 2.4 ones you 
need on the Piavca Sourceforge site, just put them into the lib and dll directories of your python distribution.

Cal3D: this is a lower level character animation library. The eventual plan is to remove 
dependencies on it but its needed for now. You can get it from: 

http://cal3d.sourceforge.net/

You will need to make the following changes to get the paths to work:

PiavcaCal3dImp->Properties->C/C++->Additional Include Directories add the path to cal3d\cal3d.h (i.e. the parent of the cal3d include directory)
PiavcaCal3dApp->Properties->C/C++->Additional Include Directories add the path to cal3d\cal3d.h
PiavcaCal3dImpp->Properties->Librarian->Additional Library Directories add the path to cal3d.lib

Example App:

PiavcaCal3dApp is an example application. It has to run in the path containing ???.cfg. 
In the unix version you can pass this directory (which should be PIAVCAPATH/???, where PIAVCAPATH
is the root of your piavca distribution) as an argument. In VStudio you can do 

PiavcaCal3dApp->Properties->Debugging->Working Directory = the path

If you haven't got python you can grep the file PiavcaCal3dApp.cpp and remove the 3 lines that 
contain references to python. There is a comment just below one of them of some lines that 
you can uncomment, to get it to do anything without python.
