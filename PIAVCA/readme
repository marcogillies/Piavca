The Piavca character animation library. 

see the install file for instructions on compiling and installing 

see http://piavca.sourceforge.net for full documentation.

The following is a brief introduction to the sub projects, for those who are interested in 
doing development on piavca.

With the Piavca distribution there are project files for VC2005, VC2003 (I try to support it but may be a bit 
more out of date) and eclipse/CDT/PyDev

There are two main directories to the Source tree. src contains pure C++ code, this is the core of Piavca,
and Python contains python code and Python modules. I will list the various sub modules and give brief descriptions
but first an important note:
 
NB if you make any changes to the Piavca API (basically the header files in the PiavcaAPI folder) and you want 
them to be reflected in Python you will need to regenerate the Python bindings. See the readme file in 
Piavca/Python/Piavac/Piavca_base for instructions on how to do this. You will need SWIG (www.swig.org) see the 
install file for more details of how to get it.

=== src ===

This contains a number of projects of c++ code (see readme files in individual directories for more details)

= Piavca API =

The core API. Is platform independent and doesn't depend on anything (but you need an implementation
like the PiavcaCal3DImp to use it). If you make any changes you need to regenerate the Python wrappers
(see above)

= StdMotionImp = 

An animation implemenation based on bvh files. This is part of the core of piavca and required to use it.

= PiavcaCal3dImp = 

An implemenation of Piavca using Cal3d. This is probably what more people will use, but you don't have to 
you can port piavca to another animation engine. This project is a libarary that can then be used by
applications or the python bindings

= PiavcaPythonInterface = 

Some bindings to help run python scripts from within a C++ application. 

= PiavcaCal3dApp = 

An example application using only C++ (and glut)

= PiavcaWindowsSetup = 

A windows installer for Piavca

= XVR2Piavca = 

Bindings to use Piavca with the XVR graphics engine




== Python ===

This directory contains a few scripts that launch simple Piavca applications (Viewer.py is the simplest).

Inside the directory is the Piavca directory, which is a python Package. Just do 

import Piavca

and you have access to the full Piavca functionality. The code consists of some pure python code, including a
gui based engine for controlling character (requries wxPython) and a few extra Motion types (e.g. PCA and MotionGraphs,
both require scipy). There are also some python wrappers for C++ code (they all use SWIG (www.swig.org) to do the 
wrapping, you will need this if you make changes). In the following directories

= Piavca_base = 

This is the wrapper around the main PiavcaAPI

= PiavcaGlut = 

code to bring up a glut window and display Piavca characters.

= SpeechToTextInterface = 

Python bindings for the microsoft Speech to Text API. NB this requires the microsoft speech API and won't compile without it. 
However, it isn't required to use Piavca.
