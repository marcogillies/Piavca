    SpeechToTextInterface Project Overview
========================================================================

This is a slightly perpheral part of Piavca. It is a simple binding for the 
Windows Speech to Text API to Python that is used to integrate speech understanding to Piavca.
Currently it is windows based and isn't required for more use of Piavca. It won't compile if you don't 
have windows Speech API but it isn't a problem if it doesn't work.
